```


## üîß Implementation Details

### GPU Spatial Grid Partitioning
The engine uses a sophisticated spatial partitioning system that divides the simulation space into a uniform grid. Each particle is assigned to grid cells, dramatically reducing the number of collision checks from O(n¬≤) to approximately O(n + k) in most cases.

### GPU Collision Response
All collision detection and response calculations are performed in parallel on the GPU using compute shaders, allowing for real-time simulation of millions of interacting particles.

### Verlet Integration
The engine employs Verlet integration for numerical stability and energy conservation, ensuring smooth and realistic particle motion over time.

### Current Limitations
- **2D Only**: Currently supports 2D simulations
- **Circle Shapes**: Only circular particles are supported at this time

## üìä Performance

**Test Configuration:**
- **GPU**: AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT
- **OS**: Windows 11
- **Build**: Release mode (`--release`)

The engine demonstrates excellent scaling characteristics, maintaining smooth framerates even with millions of active particles thanks to GPU parallelization.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Compute shaders optimization
- Rendering optimization
- Improve physics
